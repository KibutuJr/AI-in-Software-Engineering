## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates the application of Artificial Intelligence in software engineering, tackling theoretical concepts, practical implementation, and ethical considerations. The goal is to explore how AI can automate tasks, enhance decision-making, and improve development workflows.

This assignment is structured into three major parts:
- ✅ Theoretical Analysis
- 🛠 Practical Implementation
- 🧠 Ethical Reflection

## 1️⃣ Theoretical Analysis

**Location:** `/docs/theoretical.rst`

### Contents:
- **Q1:** How AI-powered tools like GitHub Copilot reduce development time, and their limitations.
- **Q2:** Comparison of supervised vs. unsupervised learning in the context of automated bug detection.
- **Q3:** Importance of bias mitigation in AI-powered UX personalization, including real-world risks and solutions.

Each question is answered with clarity, supported by relevant examples and concise explanations that reflect best practices in AI-assisted development.

## 2️⃣ Case Study – AIOps in DevOps

**Location:** `/docs/aiops-flow.png`

We examined how AIOps enhances DevOps through automation, with a focus on:
- Predictive scaling (infrastructure auto-scaling before load spikes)
- Automated rollback (detecting release failures and triggering rollback)

The architecture diagram illustrates the full CI/CD + AIOps flow.

## 3️⃣ Practical Implementation

### 🧠 Task 1: AI-Powered Code Completion
**Location:** `/Tasks/Task1/`

- Objective: Write a function to sort a list of dictionaries by a given key.
- Tools: GitHub Copilot + Manual Code
- Deliverables:
  - Copilot vs. manual code comparison
  - Performance benchmark
  - 200-word analysis

### 🔎 Task 2: Automated Testing with AI
**Location:** `/Tasks/Task2/`

- Objective: Automate login functionality testing using AI-assisted tools.
- Tools: Selenium IDE or Testim.io
- Deliverables:
  - Test script
  - Screenshots of test results
  - 150-word summary

### 📊 Task 3: Predictive Analytics for Resource Allocation
**Location:** `/Tasks/Task3/`

- Objective: Train a model to predict task priority using the Breast Cancer dataset.
- Tools: Pandas, Scikit-learn
- Deliverables:
  - Preprocessing pipeline
  - Random Forest classifier
  - Evaluation metrics: Accuracy, F1-score
  - Jupyter Notebook

## 4️⃣ Ethical Reflection

**Location:** `/docs/ethical.rst`

This section covers:
- Bias risks in training data (e.g., underrepresented teams)
- Fairness strategies using IBM’s AI Fairness 360 toolkit
- Application of techniques like Reweighing and DisparateImpactRemover

Focus is given to the implications of deploying biased models in real-world scenarios and how fairness tools mitigate such risks.
